# 💣 Minesweeper Game

A console-based implementation of the classic **Minesweeper** game developed in **C++**. The project recreates the core gameplay mechanics, including random mine placement, recursive cell revealing, flagging, and win/loss detection.

---

## 📖 Overview

Minesweeper is a logic-based puzzle game where the player uncovers cells on a grid while avoiding hidden mines. Each revealed cell displays the number of adjacent mines, helping the player identify safe locations.

This project implements the game entirely in C++ using standard libraries and console-based graphics.

- 💣 10 hidden mines
- 🔢 Automatic calculation of adjacent mine counts
- 🌊 Recursive flood-fill for empty cells
- 🚩 Flag and unflag suspected mines
- 🏆 Win detection
- ❌ Game Over on mine hit
- 🖥️ Console-based user interface

## 🎮 Controls

| Action | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| R | Reveal a cell |
| F | Place or remove a flag |

Example input:

```
3 5 R
```

Reveal the cell at row **3**, column **5**.

To flag a cell:

```
3 5 F
```

## ⚙️ Game Logic

1. Randomly places **10 mines** on an **8 × 8** board.
2. Calculates the number of adjacent mines for every non-mine cell.
3. Allows the player to:
   - Reveal cells
   - Flag suspected mines
4. Automatically reveals neighboring empty cells using recursion.
5. Ends the game if a mine is revealed.
6. Declares victory when all safe cells are uncovered.
